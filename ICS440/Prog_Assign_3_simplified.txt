Your task is to implement the Router class.

This is the class that forwards packets to the next router on the way to their destination.

As you can see, Router implements Runnable.

The main() method calls the addWork() method in Router, once it has created the Packet.

The addWork() method enqueues the work to that particular thread.

The end() method indicates to Router that, once there are no more packets in the network, it should return.

The run() method (from Runnable) does the following:
waits until the queue has some contents,
then records the number of the current router in the packet.

If the router is not the packet’s destination,
it forwards that packet to the appropriate next router in the routing table
by calling the addWork() method for that instance of Router, with the packet as the argument.

Since there is one instance of Router for each router in the network,
addWork() must add to the queue that corresponds to the correct router.

Under no circumstances should any router process a packet more than once.

If this is the destination router for the network,
the router should record itself, but should not forward the packet any further.

Router should use the monitors we discussed in class to manage its synchronization.
