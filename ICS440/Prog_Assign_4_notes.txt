Ultimately, choose domain decomposition using a 2D grid, because we're
interested in partitioning the data (the 2D adjacency matrix in this case).

Figure out another method using functional decomposition (this won't
actually be used, but required for the assignment). Find a way to partition
the computation.

Actually, it might even be the opposite of the above outline. For reference,
the Wikipedia entry on Parellelizing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, found at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_all-pairs_shortest_path_algorithm
seems to indicate that it is the computation that should be partitioned in
the distance matrix. Each square p(i,j) will perform its own piece of the
computation.

Now, after further thought, I believe it will be a combination of the two.

Both the computation to be performed AND the data upon which the computation
is to be performed must be partitioned in some fashion.
